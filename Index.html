Hawking regards it a triumph that we, who are mere stardust, have come to such a detailed
understanding of the universe in which we live. We evolved to be smarter than our ape-like ancestors, so it's quite likely for us to acquire higher intelligence than
the previous generations.<br> According to Moore's law, computers double there speed and memory capacity every
18 months. So, if this law is true, then as a result, computers are likely to overtake human in intelligence at some point in the next 
100 years. The potential benefits are huge, and we cannot predict what we might achieve when this cutting-edge technology
is magnified by the tools AI may provide. Eradication of diseases and poverty is possible. Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history...Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to mitigate the potential risks.

So, it's a welcome change that the people are studying instead the future of intelligence. We are aware of the potential dangers but perhaps with the tools of this new technology and revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialization. Hawking predicted that by 2025 there will be about 30 mega cities, each with more than 10 million inhabitants. With all those people climbing for goods and services to be delivered whenever they want them, can technology help us pace with our craving for instant commerce? <Br> For that robots will definitely speed up the online retail process but to revolutionize shopping they need to be fast enough to allow same day delivery on every order.

When the typewriter was invented, it liberated the way we interact with machines. Nearly 150 years later, touch screens have unlocked new ways to communicate with the digital world. Recent AI landmarks such as self driving cars or computer winning at the game of chess, a science of what is to come. Enormous levels of investment are foreign into this technology which already forms the major part of our lives. In the coming decade it will permit every aspect of society.
When we invented fire we must stop repeatedly, then invented the fire extinguisher. With more powerful technology such as nuclear weapons, synthetic biology and strong artificial intelligence, we should instead plan ahead and aim to get things right for the first time, because it may be the only chance we will get. Our future is a race between the growing power of heart technology and the wisdom with which we use it. So let's make sure that the wisdom wins.
